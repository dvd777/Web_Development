        <h1>MESSI</h1>

        <img src="images/messiimg1.jpg">
        <P><b>Lionel Andrés Messi</b>[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June
            1987),
            also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for<a
                href="https://www.ligue1.com/">league 1</a>club Paris
            Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of
            all
            time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in
            2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire
            professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles,
            seven
            Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa
            América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records
            for
            most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most
            assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South
            American
            male (102). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a
            player for a single club</P>
        <p>Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut
            aged 17
            in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and
            in
            his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football;
            that
            year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four
            consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12
            season, he
            set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as
            Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind
            Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign,
            becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which
            he
            was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record
            sixth
            Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.</p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[10] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel
            factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his
            father's
            side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic
            Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3]</p>
